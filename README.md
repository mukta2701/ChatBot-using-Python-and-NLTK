# Create-a-chatbot-using-Python-and-NLTK

The code provided is a Python script that implements a simple chatbot using a neural network. The chatbot is designed to understand user input and respond appropriately based on predefined intents.

The script first loads a pre-trained neural network from a saved model file. Then, it defines several functions to preprocess user input, predict the intent of the input, and retrieve a response from a JSON file containing predefined intents and responses. Finally, it creates an interactive loop that prompts the user for input and responds with an appropriate message until the user exits the loop.

In more detail, the script:

Imports necessary libraries such as Keras, NumPy, NLTK, and pickle.
Defines a WordNetLemmatizer object for stemming words.
Loads a JSON file containing predefined intents and responses.
Loads saved files containing a list of unique words and a list of unique intents/classes.
Loads a pre-trained neural network model from a saved file.
Defines several functions for preprocessing user input, predicting the intent of the input, and retrieving a response from the JSON file.
Creates an interactive loop that prompts the user for input and responds with an appropriate message until the user exits the loop.
